Around the age of ten, I became obsessed with programming on my home computer. In an effort to coax me from the house, my mum bought me a skateboard and it worked; I went on to travel the world as a professional skateboarder. After giving demonstrations in Japan, I became interested in the country's language and completed a degree in Japanese. Having worked as a translator in London and rural Japan, I returned to programming and completed both an MSc in Computer Science and an intensive 12-week software development boot camp at Makers Academy. I now work in London as a Software Developer, using such technologies as PHP, Laravel, JavaScript, and Vue.js.
