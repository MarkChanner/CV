A one-time professional skateboarder with degrees in Japanese and Computer Science. I'm wired differently.

Around the age of ten, I became obsessed with programming on my home computer. In an effort to coax me from the house, my mum bought me a skateboard and it worked; I went on to travel the world as a professional skateboarder. After giving skateboarding demonstrations in Japan, I became interested in the country's language and, upon returning to London, completed a degree in Japanese. After working for several years as a translator in both London and rural Japan, I returned to programming, and completed an MSc in Computer Science while continuing to work full-time. I now work in London as a Software Developer, using such technologies as Laravel, Vue.js, and GraphQL.
